# Pipeline Test Updates

This document summarizes the changes made to update the pipeline tests to match the implementation changes.

## Key Implementation Changes

1. **Async Processing Pipeline**:
   - The `run_processing_pipeline` function now uses async/await syntax throughout
   - All pipeline steps use await for better performance

2. **Audio Generation Tools**:
   - Updated to use async functions and proper error handling
   - Added support for fallbacks when audio generation fails

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Improved error capture and reporting
   - Added fallback mechanisms for each processing stage

4. **Data Structure Updates**:
   - Transcript tool now returns results with a top-level "results" key
   - Audio paths and file naming conventions have been updated

## Test Updates

### 1. Created New Test File: `test_run_processing_pipeline.py`

This tests the processing pipeline function directly with these test cases:
- Basic pipeline flow testing integration with agents
- Error handling and failure reporting
- Audio generation success path
- Audio generation fallback mechanisms

### 2. Updated `test_api_v1.py`

- Updated mock configurations for async compatibility
- Fixed assertion paths to reflect new response structures
- Added more specific assertions to verify proper function calls
- Allowed for both "queued" and "pending" status in tests for flexibility

### 3. Updated `test_pipeline_integration.py`

- Updated mock response formats to match new data structures
- Added the "results" key in the transcript mock responses
- Updated assertions to check for "final_audio_path" instead of "audio_path"
- Enhanced agent mocks to provide more realistic response formats

## Testing Approach

The tests now cover three levels of the pipeline:

1. **Function Level** (test_run_processing_pipeline.py):
   - Direct testing of the pipeline function
   - Focused on error cases and recovery

2. **Integration Level** (test_pipeline_integration.py):
   - Testing the pipeline with the task manager
   - Verifying agent interactions and data flow

3. **API Level** (test_api_v1.py):
   - Testing the API endpoints that trigger the pipeline
   - Verifying proper task management and status updates

All tests have been updated to use proper async/await patterns and to mock the appropriate dependencies.
