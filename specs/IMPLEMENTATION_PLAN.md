# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan provides a step-by-step guide for executing the major features and architectural improvements defined in the `specs/` directory of the Podcast Digest Agent project. It is intended for all contributors and maintainers to ensure a consistent, high-quality, and maintainable codebase. Each section corresponds to a major specification or feature, with clear goals, actionable steps, and references to detailed specs.

## Goals

1. Deliver features in a logical, dependency-aware order
2. Ensure each feature is implemented according to its specification
3. Track progress and completion status for each major feature
4. Provide links and context for deeper technical details
5. Encourage best practices, code quality, and documentation

---

## Feature Implementation Sequence

The following is the recommended order for implementing the features/specs in the `specs/` directory. Each section below provides a summary, goals, and actionable steps for the corresponding spec.

---

### 1. Frontend-Backend Integration

**Spec:** [`FRONTEND_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`](./FRONTEND_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md)

**Goal:**  
Connect the Next.js frontend to the FastAPI backend, replacing all mock data with real API calls and enabling real-time updates via WebSockets.

**Key Steps:**
- Implement the API client in the frontend (`src/lib/api-client.ts`)
- Implement the WebSocket manager for real-time status updates
- Replace mock data in `WorkflowContext` with real API integration
- Ensure type safety between frontend and backend (shared TypeScript interfaces)
- Implement error handling and loading states in the UI
- Test the full integration flow (unit, integration, and E2E tests)

**Dependencies:**  
- Backend API endpoints and WebSocket must be functional (see Feature Roadmap)

**Status:**  
- [ ] Not started
- [ ] In progress
- [ ] Complete

---

### 2. Project Restructuring

**Spec:** [`PROJECT_RESTRUCTURING.md`](./PROJECT_RESTRUCTURING.md)

**Goal:**  
Refactor the codebase to follow modern, modular, and maintainable software architecture for both backend and frontend.

**Key Steps:**
- Create new directory structures for backend and frontend as outlined in the spec
- Move and refactor code incrementally, updating imports and tests
- Separate domain logic, API schemas, infrastructure, and utilities
- Update build and deployment configurations as needed
- Maintain test coverage and backward compatibility during migration

**Dependencies:**  
- Should be started after or in parallel with initial integration, but before major new features

**Status:**  
- [ ] Not started
- [ ] In progress
- [ ] Complete

---

### 3. Code Cleanup

**Spec:** [`CODE_CLEANUP.md`](./CODE_CLEANUP.md)

**Goal:**  
Address technical debt, standardize code style, improve type safety, and optimize performance across the codebase.

**Key Steps:**
- Fix Pydantic v2 compatibility issues
- Improve type annotations and validation
- Refactor error handling and implement a custom exception hierarchy
- Standardize code organization and module structure
- Set up and enforce linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks
- Remove unused code and dependencies
- Optimize backend and frontend performance

**Dependencies:**  
- Should follow or be done in parallel with restructuring

**Status:**  
- [ ] Not started
- [ ] In progress
- [ ] Complete

---

### 4. Docker Containerization

**Spec:** [`DOCKER_CONTAINERIZATION.md`](./DOCKER_CONTAINERIZATION.md)

**Goal:**  
Containerize the backend and frontend for consistent development, testing, and production deployment.

**Key Steps:**
- Create Dockerfiles for backend and frontend
- Implement docker-compose for local development and production
- Set up environment variable management and secrets handling
- Configure Nginx for production routing and SSL
- Test local and production deployments
- Document the containerization and deployment process

**Dependencies:**  
- Should be done after initial integration and code cleanup for best results

**Status:**  
- [ ] Not started
- [ ] In progress
- [ ] Complete

---

### 5. Feature Roadmap

**Spec:** [`FEATURE_ROADMAP.md`](./FEATURE_ROADMAP.md)

**Goal:**  
Track the overall progress of all major features, phases, and testing strategies for the project.

**Key Steps:**
- Use the roadmap as a checklist for backend and frontend milestones
- Ensure all API endpoints, WebSocket, and agent pipeline features are implemented and tested
- Update the roadmap as features are completed or requirements change
- Use the roadmap to coordinate with the implementation plan

**Dependencies:**  
- All other features/specs

**Status:**  
- [ ] Not started
- [ ] In progress
- [ ] Complete

---

## How to Use This Plan

- **Start with the first incomplete feature** in the list above.
- **Read the linked spec** for detailed requirements and implementation details.
- **Check off each step** as you complete it, and update the status.
- **Coordinate with other contributors** to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth progress.
- **Update this plan** as features are completed or new specs are added.

---

## Considerations and Constraints

- Follow the [Project Rule](../README.md) and all required instructions in the codebase.
- Always reference the latest official documentation for any libraries or frameworks used.
- Maintain high code quality, test coverage, and documentation throughout the implementation process.
- Use this plan as a living documentâ€”update it as the project evolves.

**Next Feature to Work On:**  
Start with **Frontend-Backend Integration** (`FRONTEND_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`). Once complete, proceed to Project Restructuring, then Code Cleanup, and so on.
