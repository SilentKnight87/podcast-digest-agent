# Podcast Digest Agent Project Rule

### Purpose

This rule governs all code changes, investigations, and planning for the `podcast-digest-agent` project. It is designed to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and robust code, with a focus on user experience, performance, and real-time visualization of agent workflows. All contributors (human or AI) must follow these guidelines.

---

### Core Principles

- **Critical Thinking & Planning:**  
  Always think step by step. Before any code change, deeply understand the problem, plan your approach, and reflect on outcomes. Never guess or make speculative changes.
- **Incremental, Testable Changes:**  
  Make small, logical, and testable code changes. Each change should be easy to review and verify.
- **Collaboration:**  
  Treat the process as a team effort. If uncertain, pause and discuss options rather than guessing.
- **Tool Usage:**  
  If unsure about codebase structure or file content, use available tools to gather information. Never assume or make up code or structure.
- **Documentation-First Development:**  
  Always consult the latest official documentation for any package or library being used. Never rely on outdated information or assumptions about how a library works.

# IMPORTANT:

# Always read [FEATURE_ROADMAP.md](mdc:specs/FEATURE_ROADMAP.md) before writing any code and for UI code read `specs/UI_SPECIFICATIONS.md`

# After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update specs/FEATURE_ROADMAP.md and/or specs/UI_SPECIFICATIONS.md.

# For the WebSocket and API implementation, refer to the mock data structure in `podcast-digest-ui/mock_data.json`.

# When implementing features using external libraries, ALWAYS consult their latest documentation:
# - [Next.js Documentation](mdc:https:/nextjs.org/docs)
# - [shadcn/ui Documentation](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com/docs)
# - [Tailwind CSS Documentation](mdc:https:/tailwindcss.com/docs)
# - [FastAPI Documentation](mdc:https:/fastapi.tiangolo.com)
# - [Framer Motion Documentation](mdc:https:/www.framer.com/motion)
# - [React Query Documentation](mdc:https:/tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview)

### Workflow

#### 1. Deep Understanding
- Carefully read and analyze the issue or feature request.
- Investigate the codebase: search for relevant files, functions, and context.
- Validate your understanding as you gather more information.
- Research the latest documentation for any libraries or frameworks involved.

#### 2. Planning
- Develop a clear, step-by-step plan before making any code changes.
- Break down the solution into small, incremental, and verifiable steps.
- Reflect on the plan and adjust as new information is discovered.
- Reference official documentation for any dependencies or libraries used.

#### 3. Codebase Investigation
- Use code search, file reading, and directory exploration to gather all necessary context.
- Never edit code without first reading the relevant section in full.

#### 4. Making Code Changes
- Only modify code directly related to the current task.
- Avoid broad or speculative changes.
- Ensure all changes are consistent with the project's architecture, style, and conventions.

#### 5. Debugging
- Debug only after a clear hypothesis is formed.
- Use logs, print statements, or temporary code to inspect state and behavior.
- Focus on identifying and fixing root causes, not just symptoms.

#### 6. Final Verification
- Confirm the root cause is fixed and the solution is robust.
- Review logic, edge cases, and potential regressions.
- Ensure all tests pass and consider writing additional tests for uncovered scenarios.

#### 7. Reflection & Additional Testing
- Reflect on the original intent and user experience.
- Consider hidden or edge cases.
- Write and run additional tests as needed.
- Iterate until confident the solution is comprehensive.

### Tech Stack Guidelines

#### Frontend (Next.js + shadcn/ui)
- Use Next.js 14+ with App Router for all frontend development
- Implement all UI components using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- Use TypeScript for all code, with proper interfaces and types
- Use Lucide icons for iconography
- Use Framer Motion for complex animations
- Always follow the latest best practices and patterns from the official documentation

#### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- Implement API endpoints following the specifications in FEATURE_ROADMAP.md
- Use FastAPI for REST API and WebSocket implementation
- Ensure all agent status tracking follows the data model in mock_data.json
- Use async Python for all I/O operations
- Follow FastAPI's official documentation for API design patterns

---

### Code Style & Structure

#### Frontend Structure
- Organize by features within the Next.js app directory structure
- Use React Server Components where appropriate
- Create reusable components in a components directory
- Follow the shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS patterns for styling
- Keep component files small and focused on a single responsibility

#### Backend Structure
- Organize Python code by domain (agents, tools, utils, etc.)
- Create clear interfaces between components
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Follow FastAPI best practices for route organization

#### TypeScript Guidelines
- Define proper interfaces for all data structures
- Use the data model from mock_data.json as the basis for TypeScript interfaces
- Prefer type safety over any/unknown types
- Use React Context for state management across components
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

---

### Design System

- Follow the color palette, typography, spacing, and other design tokens defined in specs/UI_SPECIFICATIONS.md
- Always use design tokens and shadcn/ui variables instead of hard-coded values
- Maintain dark mode support using the ThemeProvider
- Reference the following color tokens:
  ```
  Primary: #7C3AED (Violet 600)
  Primary Dark: #6D28D9 (Violet 700)
  Secondary: #06B6D4 (Cyan 500)
  Accent: #F59E0B (Amber 500)
  ```
- Use the defined spacing scale (4px base unit)
- Follow the typography scale defined in UI_SPECIFICATIONS.md

---

### Agent Visualization Implementation

- Follow the detailed specifications in UI_SPECIFICATIONS.md for agent workflow visualization
- Implement the data model exactly as specified in mock_data.json
- Use Framer Motion for animation of data flow between agents
- Ensure all visualizations are responsive across device sizes
- Make visualizations accessible with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Support both polling and WebSocket modes for updates
- Add proper loading, error, and empty states for the visualization

---

### Documentation and Learning Resources

- **Always refer to the latest official documentation** when implementing features using specific libraries or frameworks
- When encountering unfamiliar packages, take time to understand their core concepts and best practices
- Verify that the implementation approach follows current recommended patterns from library maintainers

- Use the WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
- Follow security best practices for input validation and data handling
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Ensure responsive performance on all device types

---

### Testing & Quality Assurance
