# Frontend Deployment Ready! üéâ

Your frontend is built and ready to deploy to Vercel. The backend is already deployed at:
`https://podcast-digest-agent-kzpyml5rvq-uc.a.run.app`

## Manual Deployment Steps

Since there's an npm cache permission issue, you need to deploy manually:

### Option 1: Fix npm permissions and use CLI

```bash
# Fix npm cache permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm

# Then deploy
cd podcast-digest-ui
npx vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Select the `podcast-digest-ui` directory as the root directory
4. Configure the following environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = `https://podcast-digest-agent-kzpyml5rvq-uc.a.run.app`
5. Click "Deploy"

### Option 3: Use Vercel Git Integration

1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/new
   - Import from GitHub
   - Select your repository
   - Choose `podcast-digest-ui` as the root directory
   - Add environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`

## After Deployment

Once your frontend is deployed and you have the Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`), update your backend CORS settings:

```bash
./scripts/update-backend-cors.sh https://your-app.vercel.app
```

## Current Status
